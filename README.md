### Setup and Installation

#### Clone / Download Repo
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. If you do not have git installed in your system, skip this step and go to step 3; otherwise, go to the directory where you want to copy the project files and clone it by copying this text into your command prompt/terminal: `git clone git@github.com:StarSheriff2/odin-kittens.git`.
<br>Now go to ***"Install Dependencies"*** section
3. Download the program files by clicking on the green button that says ‚Äú**Code**‚Äú on the upper right side of the project frame.
4. You will see a dropdown menu. Click on ‚Äú**Download ZIP**‚Äú.
5. Go to the directory where you downloaded the **ZIP file** and open it. Extract its contents to any directory you want in your system.

#### Install Dependencies

1. If you are not in your system terminal/command prompt already, please open it and go to the directory where you cloned the remote repository or extracted the project files.
2. While in the project root directory, type `bundle install`. This command will install all the necessary gems in your system.
3. Then you can type <code>yarn install --check-files</code>.

#### Database Setup

1. Run `rails db:migrate`
2. Now run `rails db:seed`

## Usage
1. In your terminal, run <code>bin/rails server</code> while inside the root directory of the repository files
2. Go to your browser of choice and enter this URL: http://localhost:3000/
3. To get a JSON response from the browser, type any of the following in the URL bar:
    - `http://localhost:3000/kittens.json`
    - `http://localhost:3000/kittens/1.json`
4. To get the JSON response in your terminal, follow these steps:
    - Open your terminal and go the project's root directory
    - type `irb` in the terminal prompt to load the **Interactive Ruby Shell** enviroment
    - copy this into the IRB prompt: `require 'rest-client'`
    - now type something like this: `response = RestClient.get("http:localhost:3000/kittens", :accept => :json)`, and hit **return**
    - it should return something like: ***`=> <RestClient::Response 200 "[{\"id\":1,\"n...">`***
    - now render the response, by typing `response.body`
    - You should see a lot of output in JSON format!
    - Follow the same steps to render any kitten page in the same manner, by substituting `http:localhost:3000/kittens` with `http:localhost:3000/kittens/1` or any other number that corresponds to the id of a kitten record
